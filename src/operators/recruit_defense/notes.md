# Recruit Defense

## Gameplay Description

The Recruit is the default Operator featured in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. The Recruit is available in all playlists except Ranked and Unranked unless you know things.

Instead of preset loadouts varying by CTU, attacking and defending recruits can now select different weapons and equipment in a similar manner to Operators. Sights and attachments are all automatically equipped to each weapon, weapon skins and attachment skins also cannot be equipped.

Available to all, the Defend Recruit has a specific loadout with preset attachments but no unique gadget, designed to learn the basics of a defending round.
