# Pulse

## Gameplay Description

Pulse comes equipped with his HB-5 Cardiac Sensor which detects the heartbeats of nearby enemies through obstacles.

- The Heartbeat Sensor creates scan lines from left to right, highlighting Attacker hearts in proximity every time the scan lines pass through them, even through walls.
- An Attacker's heart is shown by a red dot on the Heartbeat Sensor and a white circle is shown around it.
  - Normal Attackers can be detected by the Heartbeat Sensor from a maximum of 9 meters away.
  - Attackers boosted by Finka's Adrenal Surge can be detected by the Heartbeat Sensor up to 14 meters away.
- Every time the Heartbeat Sensor detects an Attacker, it beeps once. The beeping sound that the Heartbeat Sensor emits gets louder as the proximity between Pulse and his target gets closer. When targets get closer the red dot will grow larger in low proximity.
  - Enemies will not be able to hear the beeping from the Heartbeat Sensor, but will be able to hear Pulse taking out and putting away the Heartbeat Sensor. This however, is fairly difficult since the noise made is quite low.
- The Heartbeat Sensor can scan directly through walls and floors. No matter how many obstacles are in its way it will scan a target within 9 meters.
- Paired with a Nitro Cell, Pulse becomes a formidable force as he can scan for enemies through walls and effectively take them out.

### Strategies/Synergies

- The Heartbeat Sensor is viable for vertical play (i.e. Defuser plant denial). The Heartbeat Sensor becomes more useful when used vertically than horizontally.

### Counters

- The Heartbeat Sensor is an electronic gadget, making it vulnerable to a number of Attacker gadgets:
  - IQ can easily locate and eliminate Pulse through soft walls or floors by detecting Pulse's Heartbeat Sensor when it is being used
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades will temporarily disable the Heartbeat Sensor for 15 seconds if Pulse is in range of the EMP blast
  - Impact EMP Grenades will disable the Heartbeat Sensor for 9 seconds
