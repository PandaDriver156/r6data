# Wamai

## Gameplay Description

Wamai's Unique Gadget is the Mag-NET, essentially a powerful electromagnet that intercepts and redirects projectiles towards itself, then detonates them. As well as drawing projectiles away from their intended targets, it can be used strategically to use Attacker's projectiles against them.

- Wamai starts the round with 1 Mag-NET and gains another every 40 seconds into the round. He will gain a new one right as the Action Phase begins.
- The Mag-NET is deployed by throwing and can stick to any surface, except other gadgets.
  - Mag-NETs can be easily destroyed by any damage source; including melees and gunfire.
- When an Attacker projectile enters a Mag-NET's active radius of 3.5 meters and line of sight, the Mag-NET will stop the projectile's flight midair, reset the projectile's detonation timer, attract the projectile toward it, then detonate it at the Mag-NET's location 3.5 seconds after the Mag-NET has grabbed the projectile.
  - Each Mag-NET can only grab one projectile, up to 6 projectiles in total.
  - If a Mag-NET is destroyed before its projectile explodes, the grabbed projectile will be dropped and return to normal behavior.
  - Projectiles attracted by Mag-NETs are physically normal, and those that can be destroyed by gunfire can still be destroyed when they are captured.
  - Mag-NETs have a light throwing profile, similar to Impact Grenades. This means Mag-NETs can be thrown a fair distance if need be.
- The Mag-NET can attract and detonate Attacker projectiles and gadgets, including:
  - Frag Grenades
  - Smoke Grenades
  - Stun Grenades
  - Impact EMP Grenade
  - Projectiles from the GONNE-6
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades
  - Ash's Breaching Rounds
  - Fuze's Cluster Charges
  - Capitão's Smoke Grenade and Asphyxiating Bolts
  - Ying's Candelas
  - Nomad's Airjabs
  - Zofia's Concussion and Impact Grenades
  - Gridlock's Trax Stingers. Trax Stingers are not detonated by the Mag-NETs, and will instead drop to the ground after the Mag-NETs self-destruct, and trigger and release Stingers normally.
  - Kali's LV Lances
  - Ace's SELMAs
  - Zero's ARGUS Cams
  - Sens's ROU Projector System. ROU Projectors are not detonated by the Mag-NETs, and will instead drop to the ground after the Mag-NETs self-destruct, and trigger and release the ROU in a random direction.
  - Grim's Kawan Hives. Kawan Hives are not detonated by the Mag-NETs, and will instead drop to the ground after the Mag-NETs self-destruct, and trigger and release the Kawan Hive normally.
- Hibana's X-KAIROS Pellets and Twitch's Shock Drone charges are not affected by the Mag-NET.
- One projectile cannot simultaneously activate Wamai's Mag-NETs and Jäger's ADS.
  - If a projectile simultaneously enters the active radius of a Mag-NET and an ADS, the ADS is prioritized over the Mag-NET.
- Kills caused by projectiles that were attracted by Mag-NETs are attributed to the original owners of the projectiles, except in the case where a Hostage who has not moved is damaged by a projectile attracted by a Mag-NET, in which case Wamai is considered to have injured the hostage.
  - If the Hostage was moved by an Attacker picking them up however, damage dealt to the hostage from a projectile attracted by a Mag-NET is attributed to the Attacker.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Wamai can work with Goyo to make the Volcán Canister act like a trap if Attackers were to throw an explosive like a Frag Grenade into a Mag-NET's area of effect. The Mag-NET would pull the Frag Grenade to itself and detonate the Volcán Canister.

### Counters

- IQ can detect the Mag-NET, just like other electronic gadgets.
- If the Mag-NETs do not have a direct line of sight of Thatcher's EMP grenades, they will disable the Mag-NETs for 15 seconds.
- While not a direct counter, Fuze's Cluster Charge can destroy a Mag-NET, whilst the other charges can explode within the room.
- Twitch's Shock Drone and Zero's Argus can destroy Mag-NETs.
- If close enough when deployed on a wall, Kali's LV Lances can destroy Mag-NETs.
