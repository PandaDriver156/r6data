# Kaid

## Gameplay Description

Kaid is equipped with two throwable "Rtila" Electroclaws that can be thrown onto any surface it can attach to, electrifying metal objects within a certain radius of the gadget.

- Kaid deploys the Electroclaws by throwing them and letting them attach to surfaces.
- After an Electroclaw is deployed and attaches to a surface, it will take 4 seconds to charge up, displaying its electrifying radius in the progress. After the charge up ends, all metallic gadgets within an Electroclaw's electrifying radius are shocked.
  - The radius of each Electroclaw is 1.4 meters, meaning it is able to electrify 3 standard width reinforced walls if placed in the center.
- Gadgets shocked by Electroclaws behave identically to gadgets shocked by Bandit's Shock Wires.
  - The only difference between objects shocked by Electroclaws and objects shocked by Shock Wires is that the former show more brightly than those electrified by Bandit as there are more electrical arcs present.
- The effective radius does go through surfaces, meaning that the Electroclaw is able to electrify metal objects on the other side of a wall, as long as the Electroclaw's effective radius touches them.
- The Electroclaws are shock-proof electronic gadgets, and can thus be:
  - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
  - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
  - Disabled by Impact EMP Grenades for 9 seconds
  - Destroyed by Twitch's Shock Drones
  - Destroyed by Kali's LV Lances
  - Destroyed by Zero's ARGUS Cameras
  - Destroyed by Flores' RCE-RATERO Drone

### Strategies/Synergies

- Kaid and Bandit can work together to maximize protection of a room with their electrifying devices. As a result, they have similar roles.
  - Mute's Signal Disruptors can work together with electrified objects in stopping or destroying Attacking gadgets during the game, especially against Drones during and after the Preparation Phase or Breach Charges during the Action Phase.
  - Attackers caught in one of Frost's Welcome Mats can also be killed by an electrified gadget such as Barbed Wire.

### Counters

- As it is still an electronic gadget, the Electroclaw is susceptible to the same disadvantages as other gadgets of its type.
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades will disable any Electroclaw within their explosive radius for 15 seconds.
  - Twitch is able to destroy the Electroclaws with her Shock Drone. However, if it comes into contact with a metal object electrified by an Electroclaw, the Drone will be destroyed instantly.
    - Compared to Bandit's Batteries, Electroclaws are easier to hide from Twitch's drones.
  - Any Electroclaw will show up on IQ's Electronics Scanner.
- As the Electroclaws have a delay before they come into effect, Kaid is not able to destroy one of Thermite's Exothermic Charges if deployed as the Charge is activated.
- Kali's LV Lances can destroy Kaid's Electroclaws even through a Reinforced Wall.
- Flores' RCE-RATERO Drones will destroy Electroclaws.
- Zero's ARGUS Camera lasers can destroy Electroclaws.
- Maverick's Breaching Torch can make small holes in walls electrified by Kaid's Electroclaws.
