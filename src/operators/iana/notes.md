# Iana

## Gameplay Description

Iana's unique gadget is the Gemini Replicator. When activated, it creates a holographic decoy of Iana, which she can control remotely like a drone. It allows Iana to scout ahead and spot traps without setting them off, and can also trick Defenders into exposing themselves or acting prematurely.

- The Hologram looks and moves exactly like Iana, including whatever uniform, headgear, and weapon skin that she has equipped. It's unable to climb ladders or rappel down walls, but the hologram can drop extreme heights.
  - The Gemini Replicator performs all the same sounds as Iana, such as sprinting. This also includes moving through Barbed Wire, but can't be detected by Proximity Alarms or Melusi's Banshees.
- Unlike Alibi's Prismas, shooting Iana's hologram will not result in a location ping. However, the hologram will be destroyed in a single shot if fired upon.
  - The hologram will be able to block one shot when it gets hit, seemingly able to make only one bullet vanish. This is regardless of weapon class or destruction.
- The Gemini Replicator is capable of using Ping 2.0, meaning that Iana can spot gadgets for teammates.
- While using the Hologram, Iana is unable to move herself, leaving her vulnerable. This is crucial to find a good spot to hide while she uses the Hologram.
- The Hologram will recharge its energy when not in use, though the cooldown time is slightly longer if it is destroyed rather than deactivated manually.
  - When manually deactivated, the Hologram has a cooldown time of 15 seconds.
  - When destroyed, the Hologram has a cooldown of 20 seconds.
- Clash's CCE Shield tasers will not destroy the hologram.
- Fellow teammates cannot spectate her Replicator like it's an actual drone. Her Replicator can only be viewed if they manually spectate Iana.
- Any kind of gunfire or explosives will destroy the Hologram.

### Strategies/Synergies

- While Ying's Candelas will affect Iana herself like any other Operator, it doesn't affect the Hologram. This means that Ying can have an extra set of eyes to aid her as the Hologram can scout ahead.
- Iana can assist Blitz, forcing Defenders to act prematurely while Blitz will be able to know where the Defender is, flash them, and kill them.

### Counters

- The Hologram can be destroyed by anything that can destroy a gadget, such as electrified Barbed Wire. Bandit's Shock Wire and Kaid's Electroclaws will destroy the Hologram.
- As an electronic gadget, Mute's Signal Disruptor will neutralize the Hologram once it is in the effective radius.
- The Hologram is also unable to see Vigil while his Video Disruptor is active. The Hologram also will not pick up on Vigil's presence.
- Maestro's Evil Eyes can destroy the Hologram with its laser and can detect its lack of heat signature.
