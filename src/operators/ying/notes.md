# Ying

## Gameplay Description

Ying comes equipped with her Candelas, specialized timed explosives which can either be thrown or anchored onto a deployable surface to shoot out seven flash charges into an area.

- Each Candela contains seven customized flash charges that function slightly differently to Stun Grenades.
- Candelas have two deployment options:
  - The first option would be to throw it like a regular grenade, firing flashes in a star pattern (six flashes at the corners and then one in the middle). The flashes will detonate shortly after in the order they are fired.
    - Unlike other grenades, upon contact on the ground with its delayed timer, Candelas will not bounce around. Instead, it will start to roll smoothly, continuing in the direction it was hit the ground at, rolling along walls and other physical obstacles without deflecting. A possible play with this property involves bouncing the candela off walls to control the direction it rolls in, creating a "curveball" effect around obstacles and hard-to-attack locations.
  - Alternatively, a Candela can be placed on a breakable surface, where it will act similarly to Fuze's Cluster Charges, firing its flashes on the other side of the surface. The first 5 flashes will be fired in a line from right to left with the 6th flash dropping in front of the Candela charge. The 6th flash will detonate first, followed by the rest detonating in the order they are fired.
  - The six flashes are fired and detonated every fifth of a second. The sixth flash is fired exactly when the first flash detonates.
- Both Candela deployment options utilize timed fuzes, which means that they're immune to Mute's Jammers.
  - Candelas can be "cooked" before being thrown or deployed on a breakable surface. Cooking a Candela will advance its fuze, decreasing the length of delay before detonation.
    - The delay timer starts upon contact with the ground, or immediately after the deployment animation on a breakable surface.
    - There are three lights on the Candela that will progressively light up, indicating the four stages of the "cooking" of the Candela; for each one lit, the Candela's delay timer will shorten.
    - 0 lights will set a 3 second delay, 1 light will set a 2 seconds delay, 2 lights will set a 1 second delay, 3 lights will set no delay.
- The effective range of the Flash Charges is far larger in size than a regular Stun Grenade, as it can reach across entire hallways (over 10 meters). However, the duration of each flash is half-a-second from such a distance, up to roughly 3 seconds at point-blank. However, effectiveness has been irregular due to how the flashes launch far and wide.
  - A Candelas flash effect lasts for 1.4 seconds. The maximum effectiveness of these Flash Charges is reached if the Operator is progressively flashed by all six flashes. This requires no obstruction, thus a smaller room or narrow hallway.
- Much like Fuze, the Candela can also punch through Castle's Armor Panels, though the hole left behind is much smaller.
- Unlike normal grenades, Candelas can be destroyed by gunfire if they're shot before they activate.
- Ying wears special glasses that make herself immune to her own flashes, which activate via a blue tint that can be seen from both herself and other Operators. However, she is only immune to her own Candelas, not regular Stun Grenades or Blitz's Flash Shield. Neither are her allies, which can be blinded by Ying's Candelas.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Thatcher, IQ, Twitch, Kali, Zero, and Flores, can be helpful allies when faced with a J채ger, as they can take out the ADS before they can take out Ying's Candelas.
- Fuze is a natural partner to Ying due to their similar functions. After Ying blinds enemies within with her Candela, Fuze can use his Cluster Charge to quickly take out the disoriented Defenders.
- Utility-wise, Capit찾o can be a good ally to maximize disorientating enemies with his Micro Smoke Grenades alongside Ying's Candelas. Also, Capit찾o can use his Asphyxiating Bolts to deal with disoriented Defenders.
- Candela place right under Aruni's Surya Gate will disable it.

### Counters

- Candelas can be shot and destroyed by bullets and explosions.
- Barbed Wire will slow down the Candelas' rolling speed.
- J채ger's Active Defense Systems are able to shoot down Candelas that come into range, thus preventing up to three flashes at the most.
  - Even if the Candela is allowed to dispatch its flashes, the ADS can still target each separate flash it sends out.
  - Conversely, Ying can disable all three Active Defense Systems through a well-placed Candela, provided all charges come in range of all of them.
  - Wamai's Mag-NETs can pull the Candelas elsewhere and detonate them.
- Aruni's Surya Gates can destroy the Candela, unless it rolls underneath the gap under the Gate.
- Being an electronic gadget, the Candelas can be destroyed by Bandit's Shock Wires like other gadgets of its type.
- When activated, Warden's Glance Smart Glasses make him immune to the effects of the Candela. Even after being flashed, Warden can still activate the glasses to clear up the blinding effects and allow him to see normally.
