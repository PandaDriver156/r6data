# Montagne

## Gameplay Description

Montagne comes equipped with his Extendable Shield, "Le Roc", which can fully cover him from head-to-toe while standing, providing extra protection that no other shield in the game offers. This also allows him to be the ultimate point-man, blocking enemy bullets as allies attack from his protection.

- When not extended, the Extendable Shield behaves like a normal Ballistic Shield.
- Montagne will absorb 66% of damage dealt from any source of explosive damage. This applies to all operators standing behind the shield.
- Extending and contracting the Extended Shield has a very short delay.
- When extended, the Extendable Shield covers the entire front of Montagne's body, protecting him from enemy fire and explosives. This also works with teammates behind the shield.
  - When extended, Montagne cannot shoot, melee, run, vault, change stance, or interact with any objects.
  - When extended, the Extendable Shield grants about 80Â° of horizontal protection.
  - When extended, the Extendable Shield has an inclined top granting some vertical protection. This inclined top creates less vertical vision, so going up stairs or looking upwards may be a challenge.
  - When extended, the Extended Shield greatly reduces flinching from melee attacks. Whereas a normal Ballistic Shield will be knocked aside when hit by a melee attack, Montagne's Extended Shield will only flinch, via guard break system.
- As a Shield Operator, Montagne is slightly slower than a normal Heavy Health Operator, moving at 67.5% speed, compared to a Heavy Operator's 75% speed.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Le Roc, when extended, is large enough to block a normal doorway, allowing Montagne to deny passage if he stands in the way.
- Montagne acts as a mobile wall, teammates can take advantage of the large cover and shoot from the sides of the shield.
- Montagne poses the greatest threat to the enemy team and provides an ample distraction whenever un-extending his shield.
- Montagne works well with Breaching Operators such as Sledge, Ash, Buck, Zofia, Thermite, Hibana, Ace, Flores, and Maverick, as they can create holes he can walk through efficiently as well as provide him with ample firepower.
- Le Roc, when extended, can completely block out the laser beams emitted from a Claymore, allowing for a surprise attack when Montagne retreats out of a doorway.
- While it is intuitive to stand behind Montagne's shield it is better to for Montagne to get to the side or behind enemy to give them more targets.

### Counters

- Montagne is still vulnerable from the back even when Le Roc is extended.
  - The overhead part of Le Roc consists of three panels with gaps in-between. Defenders at a higher position can easily circumvent Montagne's defenses from their vantage point.
- While impervious to bullets and melee, explosives (such as Nitro Cells or Impact Grenades) detonated from the front will potentially deal a bit of damage. These explosives can also be thrown over his shield for maximum damage.
  - When hit by explosives or melee attacks in the Extended shield mode, Montagne will briefly flinch and be exposed to other sources of damage.
- Some Operators can circumvent Montagne's defenses easier than others.
  - Smoke's Gas Grenades will bypass the Shield.
  - Lesion's Gu Mines are a good counter to Montagne, forcing him to either constantly take damage or contract and put away his shield to pull out the mine's needle.
  - Echo's Yokai Drones' sonic blasts and Ela's Grzmot concussion mines can temporarily cause a concussed effect to Montagne even when in the Extended shield mode. Each of the two effects will cause a brief shield guard break animation, meaning Montagne will be slightly more vulnerable to damage for a short period of time.
- Even with the Shield up, Montagne is still vulnerable to gadgets such as Frost's Welcome Mats and Bandit's Shock Wires, becoming downed or electrified respectively.
- Oryx's Remah Dash can knock Montagne down regardless whether or not his shield is extended, leaving him as vulnerable as anyone else.
- Clash's CCE Shield and Melusi's Banshees can slow down Montagne even further, making him even more vulnerable.
