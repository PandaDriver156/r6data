# Gridlock

## Gameplay Description

Gridlock is equipped with four Trax Stingers, devices that when deployed, unfold and spread in its proximity. Functioning similarly to Defender's Barbed Wire in that they both slow down opponents and make noise when traversing across them, Trax Stingers also damage opponents and is thus a gadget bolstering Gridlock's capability of area denial.

- Trax Stingers have a throwing profile similar to Lesion's Gu mines.
- After being thrown deployed, a Trax Stinger releases hexagonal Stingers patches in an overall hexagonal shape. The maximum amount of patches deployed is 19.
  - The deployment order is as follows:
    - The first patch is deployed at where the original Trax Stinger landed.
    - The first patch then deploys six Stingers in a circle around itself in a counterclockwise order.
    - Each of those six, going from first deployed to last, will then deploy two Stingers beside them, creating a second circle of 12 stingers.
- The Stinger patches follow a programmed order of timed deployments, so that overall, a new patch is deployed every half a second.
- A fully deployed Trax Stinger takes 8 seconds to reach.
- Destroying a patch of Stingers during the deployment process will prevent that Stinger from deploying its additional Stingers. Other intact Stingers will still deploy their Stingers in order, when it's their time to do so.
- Each Stinger patch has a maximum diameter of about half a meter.
  - If a patch lands in a location where it cannot expand to its maximum size, it'll expand as much as it can.
  - If it's too small overall, the patch will not form. This also means that the Stingers deployed from said unformed patch will not be deployed.
- A Defender stepping on a patch of stinger will receive 10 damage, get slowed down, and make noise.
  - Caveira's Silent Step and Oryx's Remah Dash is stopped if they steps on a Stinger patch.
- If a Defender triggers one of Nomad's Airjabs and is knocked back into a patch of Trax Stingers, the Stingers will not damage the Defender and will instead be destroyed.
- A patch of Stingers can be destroyed by any source of damage.
- Trax Stingers can be destroyed before rapid deployment.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Could be paired with Nomad's Airjabs.
- The sound of Trax Stingers can mask the sound of defusing.

### Counters

- Impact Grenades will destroy large clusters of the Trax Stingers.
- Shotgun pellets can destroy more Trax Stingers than other weapons.
- While not potent for destruction, a well placed Nitro Cell can destroy a good chunk of Trax Stingers.
- Wamai's MAG-NET System pulls Gridlock's Trax Stinger but will not destroy it.
