# Zofia

## Gameplay Description

Zofia has access to the KS79 LIFELINE, a double barrel launcher that can launch either impact grenades or concussion grenades.

- Zofia's KS79 LIFELINE has two Impact and Concussion Grenades. The LIFELINE is set to Impact Grenades by default and can switch between ammunition types on the fly using the fire mode key.
  - The grenades are superposed, thus the LIFELINE requires no reloading process between shots.
  - The grenades have no projectile size; they can pass through openings that are as small as a bullet hole.
- The Impact Grenades are much like normal Impact Grenades, dealing the same damage, type of destruction, and radius.
  - There is a small arc to the grenade's flight trajectory.
- Concussion Grenades work like Ela's Grzmot Mines, causing visual and mobile disruption.
  - Concussion Grenades detonate upon a 3 meter proximity to an enemy. Otherwise, there is a delay before detonating. If they hit a surface, they will rebound and detonate.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Finka's Adrenal Surge can allow Zofia to recover from the Concussive Effects even faster than normal with the 70% shorter recovery time. The Surge can also override the effect if activated afterwards. These benefits also apply to fellow allies.

### Counters

- JÃ¤ger's ADS can take out Zofia's grenades if they haven't detonated.
- Wamai's Mag-NETs can redirect both of her grenades, assuming he has two of them deployed. Otherwise, only one would detonate.
