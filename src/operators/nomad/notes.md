# Nomad

## Gameplay Description

Nomad is equipped with an Airjab launcher which can shoot out up to three "Airjab" repulsion grenades that will stick to any surface she shoots at and knock down all in its effective radius when triggered.

- Nomad has three "Airjab" repulsion grenades that shoot from a grenade launcher attached to her primary weapon. When she switches to the launcher, a laser sight turns on and becomes visible in the air (unlike the standard Laser Sight, which only creates a red dot at its aimed surface). This laser sight can be traced back to its source.
  - Switching between her Airjab launcher and primary fire is quick, like Buck's Underbarrel Shotgun.
- When deployed, the Airjab will stick to the surface it is on and become a small device with a bright light. Nomad can see its range indicated as a circle 3 meters in radius immediately after deployment.
  - The Airjab has a small delay of 1 second between when it sticks to a surface as a mine and when it can trigger.
  - The Airjab is exclusively proximity triggered (and requires line-of-sight of the torso/head) on non-downed Defenders. It will not trigger midair, neither will it trigger on Operators who are midair (such as when they are falling).
  - Airjabs only affect enemies who are on the ground. They will not affect Operators who are falling or rappelling.
  - Airjabs emit a soft beeping noise when deployed and can be heard when in close proximity.
- The Airjab pushes all Operators in range back a small distance (2 meters) and knocks them down for a few seconds. Destructible objects, including destructible walls, in the way of the flying Operator are broken, making falling damage a possibility. Breaking through a wall deals 5 damage to both opponents and allies caught within the Airjab's range.
  - The Airjab explosion does not create any vertical lift, and the pushed Operators are still moving on the ground in terms of game coding. As a result, thrown Operators will not pass over short walls, objects or raised ledges.
  - Barricades, Castle Armor Panels, and Deployable Shields will also be destroyed by a flying Operator.
  - Thrown Operators will regain their ability to shoot after they go through the first part of the thrown animation. This means that thrown Operators are only vulnerable for the couple seconds of being thrown, and while regaining their footing, they are able to to retaliate.
- The Airjab, just like Ash's Breaching Rounds, has travel time and can be shot out of the air.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Putting claymores on the same door as Airjabs will make it even harder for Defenders to run out.

### Counters

- JÃ¤ger's Magpies and Wamai's Mag-NETs can take out Airjabs.
- Mute's Jammer can disable Airjabs.
- Airjabs are vulnerable to objects electrified by Bandit or Kaid.
