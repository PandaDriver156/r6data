# Valkyrie

## Gameplay Description

Valkyrie's unique gadgets are three Mk2 "Black Eye" Gyro Cams, portable sticky cameras that can attach on almost any surface for increased surveillance.

- Valkyrie spawns with 3 Black Eyes. Valkyrie deploys the Black Eyes by throwing them and letting them stick to solid surfaces.
  - Black Eyes use a throwing profile similar to normal grenades, though they can't be thrown as far.
  - Black Eyes will bounce off of some gadgets, such as Nitro Cells.
  - Black Eyes are retrievable after being thrown, provided they are within reach.
- Black Eyes can be accessed while they are still in the air - however the video feed does not begin until they attach to a surface.
- Black Eyes are electronic gadgets, and can thus be:
  - Detected by IQ's Electronics Detector
  - Disabled by Thatcher's EMP Grenades for 15 seconds
  - Destroyed by lasers fired by Twitch's Shock Drones
- After a Black Eye deploys, its gyroscopic camera becomes available to the Defenders and is added to the camera pool.
  - Unlike normal security cameras, Black Eye cameras are gyroscopic, and can rotate close to 180 degrees both horizontally and vertically. They also rotate faster than normal cameras, and have a wider field of view.
  - The Black Eye cameras transmit a blue-tinted full-color feed, instead of the monochrome feeds of the standard CCTV, making it easier to discern certain details.
  - When a Defender is viewing a Black Eye's live feed, the gadget will glow blue, making it easier to spot by an attacker.
  - Black Eyes will disconnect 10 seconds after being placed outside.
- Black Eyes are fragile and can easily be spotted in the open; they should be concealed in important areas to both grant useful intel and prevent their discovery.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Valkyrie works well with more aggressive Defenders, such as Caveira and Pulse. Given their abilities, having additional camera feeds around the map can help cover their backs whilst giving them more awareness around areas the Black Eyes can surveil where the standard CCTVs cannot.

### Counters

- As an electronic gadget, Valkyrie's Black Eyes are vulnerable to the same disadvantages held by other gadgets of its type.
  - IQ's Electronics Scanner can spot any Black Eye that comes within its range.
  - Thatcher's EMP Grenades will disable the Black Eyes if they are within their area of effect for 15 seconds.
  - Twitch's Shock Drone can destroy a camera in a single zap.
  - Zero's Argus Camera lasers can destroy Black Eyes with careful precision.
- Due to her ability to gain access to the Defender's CCTV once she gets a hold of a deceased Defender's phone, Dokkaebi will also turn Valkyrie's Black Eyes against the Defenders.
- NÃ¸kk's HEL Presence Reduction will wipe her image from any surveillance tool, including Black Eyes.
