# Blackbeard

## Gameplay Description

Blackbeard's unique gadgets are his two Transparent Armored Rifle-Shields (TARS). They protect his head from a couple bullets, allowing a slightly higher survivability rate at the cost of mobility and recoil control.

- When equipped with one of his Rifle-Shields, Blackbeard is protected from a few shots that are directed to his head. As such, his survival rate is increased by virtue of his head being more protected than other Operators.
- Blackbeard holds two Rifle-Shields in total, and has to manually equip or de-equip them.
  - When Blackbeard still has two Rifle-Shields, pressing the equipment key will equip one of the two Rifle-Shields (the first one by default), pressing it again will de-equip it. After unequipping the shield, the game will automatically index to the other shield, and pressing the equipment key again will equip the other shield instead of the first. Unequipping the second shield will switch to the first shield, which can be equipped again.
  - Each Rifle-Shield can only withstand up to 20 HP worth of damage. Blackbeard is able to see each Shield's health, and can switch them out voluntarily.
  - The Rifle-Shield will begin to crack where bullets have hit it, reducing visibility.
  - The Rifle-Shields can be broken by only gunfire and explosive damage.
  - Each Rifle-Shield will take 20 HP worth of damage from an explosive, and are not resistant unlike actual Ballistic Shields.
- A speed penalty is incurred when the Rifle-Shield is equipped, reducing his speed from 90% down to 62.5%. However, if he unequips the Shield or switches to his D-50, he'll regain his maximum movement speed.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Blackbeard works well with Shield Operators due to the additional protection that they provide. With Blackbeard providing additional firepower, Operators like Montagne and Blitz provide him ample, mobile protection.

### Counters

- The Rifle-Shields have a limited health pool (20 HP worth of damage) before they are torn apart. As such, weapons with a high damage output or have a blistering fire rate to compensate for the damage will make quick work of them.
  - Vigil's BOSG.12.2 will make quick work of the Rifle-Shield with a single shot aimed at any part of the Rifle-Shield due to the weapon's damage output far surpassing the Shield's max health.
  - Weapons such as Smoke's SMG-11 and Mira's Vector .45 ACP shoot at a fire rate so fast it can easily compensate for their weak damage per bullet, provided of course enough of these bullets connect.
- Kapkan's Entry Denial Devices will destroy Blackbeard's shield in one hit.
