# Sledge

## Gameplay Description

Sledge wields a specialized Tactical Breaching Hammer, known as "The Caber", which can breach through almost all non-reinforced surfaces and barricades with relative silence. Because of this, Sledge is able to bust through walls, floors, and barricades with a silent yet aggressive pace.

- The Breaching Hammer creates a rectangular hole on surfaces it strikes.
  - The Breaching Hammer behaves as if it deals explosive damage; it can destroy many bulletproof gadgets, such as Barbed Wire, Deployable Shields, Castle's Armor Panels, Azami's Kiba Barriers, Bulletproof Camera and Maestro's Evil Eyes.
- The Breaching Hammer has a limited durability of 25 charges, shown by a bar above the hammer's gadget icon.
  - The Hammer can't break through non-destructible surfaces or a Reinforced Wall - attempting to do so will only consume durability.
  - Sledge's breaching hammer is capable of killing enemies in one hit, which counts as 2 charges.
- Like other gadgets in the game, Sledge takes a moment to unequip his hammer after using it. This half second delay will leave him vulnerable, but only for a short period.
- The Breaching Hammer needs to be fairly close to a wall in order to destroy both sides of the wall. Roughly within a 1 meter distance. If not, the Hammer will only break the external surface, leaving the internal one intact. This necessitates a second swing, delaying breach and wasting the Breaching Hammer's durability.
  - This also applies to floors, as Sledge needs to be a fair amount close to destroy both sides of the floor.

### Strategies/Synergies

- Sledge works well with Operators that also specialize in breaching. In Sledge's case, he is the quietest of such Operators and the most efficient.
  - Ash, Buck, Zofia, and Flores allow for breaching from a much safer distance than Sledge's Breaching Hammer, but are much louder than his Breaches.
  - Thermite, Hibana, and Ace are capable of breaching through Reinforced Walls and Hatches. In Hibana's case, she can do it from a distance and at multiple places. Maverick, while he's also capable of making such an opening, is better off making lines of sight through those walls to cover Sledge if he's breaching from a different angle.
- Thatcher can destroy devices with his EMP grenades, allowing Sledge to focus on breaching the objective. This also applies to other Operators like Twitch, Kali, Zero, and Flores.
- IQ can detect electronic objects, guiding Sledge on which gadgets to destroy if he breaches a wall.
- Sledge works well with Montagne and Blitz, as Sledge can quickly create entrances that Montagne and Blitz can take advantage of and push through.

### Counters

- Pulse can detect Sledge through his Cardiac Sensor like everyone else, giving his position away for other Defenders to take advantage of.
- Goyo can place his Volc√°n canisters on barricades and other soft surfaces to catch an unsuspecting Sledge by surprise and set him on fire.
