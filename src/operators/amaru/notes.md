# Amaru

## Gameplay Description

Amaru's unique gadget is the Garra Hook, a gadget that when activated, fires several grappling hooks then pulls her towards the hooks. This allows her to travel up hatches, second story or higher windows, or rooftops.

- The Hook can only be fired at windows, unreinforced/open hatches, skylights and rappel-able ledges at the same level as her or higher. In the case of rappel-able ledges, she can aim at positions that are at slightly lower elevations.
  - Shooting the Hook at a barricaded window will not destroy the barricade until Amaru is through the window. The Hook shoots out four visible wires that grab onto the window's corners while pulling Amaru up towards her desired target.
  - While facing a window Amaru has latched onto, four tiny puffs of smoke can be seen and a quiet sound can be heard when the Garra Hook is deployed on a window.
  - Amaru cannot use the Garra Hook on doorways, both inside and outside.
  - Indoor windows cannot be grappled. As a result, Amaru cannot use the hook to exit through windows.
  - Amaru's Garra Hook can safely travel up ledges, rails that are indoors, and even skylights.
  - Amaru cannot activate the Garra Hook while falling and in result will have damage done or possibly die to however extreme the falling is.
  - The Hook cannot be used at acute angles, such as from directly below a ledge or from the direct sides of a window.
  - The Hook shows you where you can enter and where you cannot enter. Symbols will appear on the screen wherever you point the Garra Hook, if within range of a target. White arrows means you will be able to enter that point and red means you might have to find another point or angle.
  - The Hook has a limited range, and can only be fired at valid targets in range (15 meters). The Hook also has a minimum range to use the Garra Hook.
    - Being underneath a floor the maximum range is 1 meter.
    - While being on the same floor to grapple the minimal range is 3 meters.
  - Amaru travels 7.5 meters per second while her Garra Hook is active.
  - Amaru's Garra Hook takes 3 seconds to properly latch onto ledges and windows, along with the travel time.
  - The Hook can only be fired if Amaru's path of travel is unobstructed.
  - If the Hook is aimed at a valid target and Amaru can fire the Hook at it, a white icon will show up. If the Hook is aimed at a valid target, but Amaru cannot fire the Hook at it (either due to range or obstruction), then a red icon will show up.
  - Shooting the hook to an undestroyed hatch will automatically destroy the hatch and climb Amaru up. However, this is untrue for reinforced hatches, as she cannot use her hook to enter.
- The Hook has 4 uses, and an 8 second cool down between uses. When the Hook is on cooldown its grapple will be closed.
  - Amaru starts the round with her Garra Hook on cooldown.
- While grappling, Amaru does not have access to her weapons, making her defenseless if Defenders are nearby the window she grapples, along with being vulnerable to traps such as Kapkan's EDDs and Frost's Welcome Mats.
  - However, Amaru's reaction time when ending a Garra Hook use will allow her to bring her weapons up relatively quickly. At the most, Amaru is only vulnerable for a split second once she rappels in.
- Melusi's Banshees will have no effect on Amaru until she is in the building.
- If Amaru collides into an enemy while being pulled into a window by the Garra Hook, the hit enemy will be killed by Amaru. However, this is untrue for Clash as her CCE Shield will block any entry.

### Counters

- Following gadgets could be placed under the windows where amaru might rappel into:
  - Frost's Welcome Mat
  - Kapkan's EDDs
  - Lesion's GU Mines
  - Alibi's Prismas
- Windows that are reinforced with Castle's Armor Panels cannot be targeted by the Hook, therefore, Amaru cannot enter windows blocked by Armor Panels since she cannot destroy them with her Garra Hook.
- Aruni's Surya Laser Gates will deal 30 damage when Amaru passes through the window, if the Surya Gate is deployed there.
