  - The Electronics Detector's detection range is exactly 20 meters.
  - When using the Electronics Detector, IQ can only use her secondary weapon.
- The Electronics Detector can detect the following items:
  - The Bombs in Bomb and the electronic defuser when the Bomb Defuser is being disabled
  - The Bio Container in Secure Area
  - Surveillance Cameras
  - Phones hacked by Dokkaebi (when they are being turned off) or dropped upon death
  - Any electronic gadget

### Strategies/Synergies

- Equipping a Suppressor to the P12 can prove to be an effective way of clearing enemy gadgets. The Suppressor allows for IQ to quietly take out Defender gadgets while above or below an objective in order to remain stealthy. Defenders will not receive any white notification marks if any bullets are coming, providing IQ time to take out gadgets.
- IQ works well together with Twitch, Thatcher, Kali, Zero, and Flores; Attacking Operators tasked with taking out enemy electronic gadgets.
  - IQ can also work with any other Operator with the ability to remove gadgets from afar, such as Operators with an explosive.
- Dokkaebi can help IQ find Defenders with the use of her Logic Bomb. While a Defender resets their phones, IQ can spot them for the duration of the resetting process.

### Counters

- Solis' SPEC-IO Electro Sensor can detect IQ's Electronics Detector when she is using it.
